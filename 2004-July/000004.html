<PRE>I figured out why we can't upload anything, all of our directories are
owned by root.  I sent in a support request.

I came across install-log (<A HREF="http://install-log.sourceforge.net/">http://install-log.sourceforge.net/</A>)
earlier today which is an old lfs tool.

Basically I was thinking if Spiffy used install there would be no need
to include a filelist inside of the package, and there would be little
need for complicated uninstallation.  This would make creating
packages much easier.

Here's how I was thinking it would work...

just before loading and running the installation command(s) Spiffy
would automatically run &quot;touch /var/log/install-logs/.timestamp&quot;, it
would then proceed to install everything, and when the install
completed it would run &quot;install-log package#version&quot;.  This creates a
file that contains a list of all the files that have been
added/modified/etc since &quot;touch /var/log/install-logs/.timestamp&quot; was
run.  The list is by default located in /var/log/install-logs/ however
we could move it to wherever.  The list now functions as an easy way
to uninstall packages.  Just like install-log site says now a simple
command like &quot;xargs rm &lt; /var/install-logs/package#version&quot; will
uninstall the package.

I like it, it would make creating packages just that much easier. :)
So what do you think? Yay or ney?

Kyle
